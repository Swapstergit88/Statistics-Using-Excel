## 1. a> Mean
The mean is the average of a dataset and is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.

### Business Use:
- Revenue Calculation: Average sales or revenue data to access overall performance. 
- Production Metrics: Determines average output or efficiency in manufacturing processes.
- Customer Statisfaction: Calculates average ratings or feedback scores for service quality.
- Inventory Management: Average stock levels to optimize inventory and reduce costs.
- Finacial Analysis: Computes average returns or expenses for budgeting and forecasting.
- Employee Productivity: Measures average output or hours worked to evaluate workforce efficiency.
- Marketing ROI: Average campaign performance metrics to assess marketing effectiveness.
  
## b> Median
The median is a powerful statistical tool in business for understanding central tendencies in a dataset with outliners or skewed distributions. 
It provides more accurate reflection of the "typical" value, making it invaluable for decision making and analysis. 

### Business Use:
- Salary Analysis: Determines typical employee salaries, avoiding distortion from extreme outliners.
- Real Estate Pricing: Reports median home prices to reflect typical property values.
- Customer Spending: Identifies typical spending levels, unaffected by high-spending outliners.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluate employee or sales performance in skewed datasets.
- Risk Management: Analyzes investment returns or risks, reducing impact of extreme values.
- Market Research: Understands consumer behaviour using median age, time or preferences.
  
## c> Mode ( Single and Multiple )
The mode is a powerful statistical measure that indentifies the most frequent or recurring values in dataset. A single mode higlights the dominant trend or preference,
enabling businesses to focus on key areas of interest. In case of multiple modes, it reveals diverse patterns or segments, proving deeper insights into varied behaviours or perferences. By leveraging the mode, business can make data driven decisions, optimize strategies and better align with customer or operational needs. 

### Business Use:
- Customer Feedback (Single Mode): Finds the most common issues or suggestion in customer reviews.
- Product Preference (Single Mode): Identifies the most frequently purchased product to optimize inventory.
- Sales Trends (Single Mode): Determines the most popular sales period or promotional offer.
- Market Segmentation (Multiple Mode): Identifies multiple customer preferences for targeted marketing stratergies.
- Employee Shifts (Multiple Mode): Finds the most common shift timings to schedule staff efficiently.
- Product Variants (Multiple Mode): Detects multiple popular product features to guide design improvements.
- Service Usage (Multiple Mode): Identifies peak usage times for resource allocation in service industries. 

## 2. a> Minimums
The minimum value in a dataset represents the smallest observation. This helps businesses understand lower bounds, identify inefficiencies, or set benchmarks for improvement.

### Business Cases:
- Cost Optimization: Identifies the lowest cost or expense to improve budgeting and resource allocation.
- Risk Assessment: Determines the minimum revenue or performance level to assess potential risks.
- Quality Control: Finds the lowest quality score or output to address production inefficiencies.
- Pricing Strategies: Identifies the minimum price point to remain competitive in the market.
- Inventory Management: Tracks minimum stock levels to prevent shortages and optimize supply chains.
- Employee Performance: Identifies the lowest performance metrics to provide targeted training or support.
- Energy Usage: Determines the minimum energy consumption to improve sustainablity and reduce costs. 

## b> Maximum
The maximum value in a dataset represents the largest observation. This helps businesses understand upper limits, set aspirational goals and identify peak performance or potential outliners.

### Business Cases:
- Revenue Analysis: Identifies the highest sales or revenue to set performance benchmarks.
- Capacity Planning: Determines maximum production or service capacity to optimize operations.
- Pricing Strategies: Identifies the highest price customers are willing to pay for permium products.
- Risk Management: Tracks maximum losses or expenses to access financial exposure.
- Employee Performance: Recognizes top-performing employees to reward and replicate success.
- Resource Utilization: Identifies peak resource usage to improve efficency and planning.
- Customer Engagement: Finds the maximum engagement metrics to enhance marketing strategies. 

## c> Quartile 1, 2 and 3 
Quartiles divide a dataset into 4 equal parts, providing insights into the distribution of data. 
Q1 (25th percentile) identifies the lower range
Q2 (50th percentile) represents the middle value
Q3 (75th percentile) highlights the upper range

### Business Cases:
- Performance Analysis: Uses Q1, Q2 and Q3 to evaluate employee or sales performance distribution. 
- Customer Segmentation: Divides customers into quartiles based on spending to tailor marketing strategies. 
- Inventory Management: Identifies Q1 and Q3 stock levels to optimise inventory and reduce waste. 
- Risk Assessment: Analyzes Q1 and Q3 fiancial metrics to assess variability and potential risks.
- Salary Benchmarking: Uses quartiles to compare salary distribution accross departments or industries. 
- Quality Control: Tracks Q1 and Q3 product quality metrics to identify consistency issues. 
- Budget Allocation: Divides the projects or departments into quartlies based on ROI to priortize investments. 

## 3. Variance
Variance measures the dispersion of data points from the mean, indicating how much the data varies.

### Business Use:
- Helps assess risk by understanding variability in sales or costs.
- Aids in quality control processes by identifying inconsistencies.

## 4. Central Limit Theorem
The central limit theorem states that the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.

### Business Use:
- Supports making inferences about population parameters from sample data.
- Facilitates hypothesis testing and decision-making based on sample statistics.

## 5. Margin of Errors
The margin of error quantifies the uncertainty in survey results or estimates. It provides a range within which the true population lie, given a specific confidence level.
A smaller margin indicates greater precision in the results, while larger margin indicates more variability. Understanding margin of error is essential for making informed decisions, ensuring data reliability and interpreting results accurately in research, business and policy-making. 

## Business Use:
- Market Research: Determines the accuracy of customer satisfaction surveys to refine product stratergies. 
- Quality Control: Assess production defect rates to improve manufacturing processes. 
- Election Polling: Predict elections outcomes with confidence intervals for campaign planning.
- Healthcare Surveys: Estimate patient satisfaction levels to enhance service delivery. 
- Financial Forecasting: Evaluate investment risk by analyzing market trends data. 
- Employee Feedback: Measure employee engagement to guide HR policies.
- Product Testing: Validate product performance metrics for launch decisions. 
- Advertising ROI: Analyze ad campaign effectiveness to optimize marketing analysis.
- Customer Demographics: Identify target audience preferences for tailored marketing. 
- Risk Management: Assess potiential risks in business operations using statistical confidence intervals. 

Z-score calculation:

95% confidence in decimals = 0.95
Alpha level α = (1-0.95) / 2 = 0.025
Area = 1 - 0.025 = 0.975
Z-score for 95 % Confidence level — **0.96**.

99% confidence level in decimals is 0.99. 
Alpha level α = (1-0.99) / 2 = 0.005
Area: 1 — 0.005 = 0.995. 
Z-score for 99% confidence interval — **2.57**.

## 7. XY Scatter
An XY scatter plot displays values for two variables to determine relationships or correlations.

### Business Use:
- Analyzes the relationship between customer numbers and sales levels.
- Identifies trends that can inform marketing strategies and resource allocation.

## 8. Logarithmic Scale
A logarithmic scale compresses large ranges of data into a more manageable format.

### Business Use:
- Useful for visualizing data that spans several orders of magnitude (e.g., financial data, chemistry, biology or astronomy).
- Enhances interpretation of exponential growth trends, such as sales over time.

## 9. Trendline
A trendline is a line that represents the general direction or pattern of a dataset.

### Business Use:
- Helps forecast future trends based on historical data.
