## 1. Mean
The mean is the average of a dataset and is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.

### Business Use:
- Helps assess overall performance metrics (e.g., average sales).
- Facilitates comparisons between different datasets or time periods.

## 2. Minimums
The minimum value in a dataset represents the smallest observation.

### Business Use:
- Identifies the lowest performing products or services.
- Useful in setting benchmarks for performance improvement.

## 3. Variance
Variance measures the dispersion of data points from the mean, indicating how much the data varies.

### Business Use:
- Helps assess risk by understanding variability in sales or costs.
- Aids in quality control processes by identifying inconsistencies.

## 4. Central Limit Theorem
The central limit theorem states that the distribution of sample means will approximate a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.

### Business Use:
- Supports making inferences about population parameters from sample data.
- Facilitates hypothesis testing and decision-making based on sample statistics.

## 5. Margin of Errors
The margin of error quantifies the uncertainty in survey results or estimates.

### Business Use:
- Provides confidence intervals for sales forecasts or market research results.
- Helps businesses understand potential variability in customer feedback.

## 6. Histogram
A histogram is a graphical representation of the frequency distribution of numerical data.

### Business Use:
- Visualizes data distributions to identify trends and outliers.
- Assists in understanding customer behavior patterns through sales data analysis.

## 7. XY Scatter
An XY scatter plot displays values for two variables to determine relationships or correlations.

### Business Use:
- Analyzes the relationship between customer numbers and sales levels.
- Identifies trends that can inform marketing strategies and resource allocation.

## 8. Logarithmic Scale
A logarithmic scale compresses large ranges of data into a more manageable format.

### Business Use:
- Useful for visualizing data that spans several orders of magnitude (e.g., financial data, chemistry, biology or astronomy).
- Enhances interpretation of exponential growth trends, such as sales over time.

## 9. Trendline
A trendline is a line that represents the general direction or pattern of a dataset.

### Business Use:
- Helps forecast future trends based on historical data.
- Aids in visualizing relationships between variables for better decision-making.

## 10. Forecasting
Forecasting involves predicting future values based on historical data trends.

### Business Use:
- Essential for budgeting and financial planning.
- Assists businesses in inventory management by predicting demand fluctuations.

## 11. Running Average
A running average smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights longer-term trends in data.

### Business Use:
- Useful for analyzing sales performance over time to identify seasonal trends.
- Helps businesses make informed decisions based on ongoing performance metrics.
